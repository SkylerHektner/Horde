  TitleText: Viper 1
  DescriptionText: 'Enemies hit with your darts will be afflicted by the drug selected
    for a short period of time. Repeat application will cause the duration to be extended.
    Too much, however, will cause the afflicted to explode violently destroying everything
    in the blast radius. '
  LoreText: "The Viper 1 poisons the mind, not the body. Designed to afflict the drug\u2019s
    side effects to take hold immediately on the afflicted by concentrating the formula
    and mixing it with an agent of my own creation that spreads it quickly through
    the system. Unfortunately too much of the stuff will now have the side effect
    of setting off the delicate systems in a cyborg causing a catastrophic meltdown.
    Unfortunately."
