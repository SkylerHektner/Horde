  TitleText: Rage Drug
  DescriptionText: "Application of the rage drug will cause the afflicted to be overcome
    with rage and will seek out the nearest destructible object, whether innatamite
    or living, and attack it. Afflicted will attack both friendlies and foes alike,
    but make sure to stay out of the sight of an afflicted or you\u2019ll be prioritized."
  LoreText: Omegazetoprozyne is another painkiller with an unfortunate side effect
    of uncontrollable rage. In underground fighting arenas this drug is often used
    on fighters as it numbs the senses of fear allowing for extraordinarily bloody
    matches. Highly addictive with a high rate of overdose.
