  TitleText: Dart
  DescriptionText: Darts fired will ricochet off of walls and can be used to land
    shots around corners.
  LoreText: "The darts used to administer the drugs into the enemy are actually included
    with every container of drug found. They\u2019re the standard applicator included
    in every container and are meant to be disposable. Luckily they happen to be pretty
    aerodynamic and durable enough to be bounced off walls for trick shots."
