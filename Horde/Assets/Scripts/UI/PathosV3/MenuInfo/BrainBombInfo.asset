  TitleText: Control System
  DescriptionText: 'Control system found inside the head of every one of the chromacorps
    guards. Placed underneath the brain and encases the pituitary gland controlling
    emotion. System also features a detonation system that completely obliterates
    the controlled via network. '
  LoreText: The prosthetic augmentation on the heads of each of these guards are actually
    pretty low tech and make it much harder to do their intended job, but the control
    system makes it much easier to control these men. And of course if things go wrong
    you can wash your hands of the evidence with a single command. The chemicals I
    use actually affect this system and allows me to cause the detonation.
